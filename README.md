## Work done
 * Nothing ATM

## Work in progress
 * Start Apache/MariaDB/PHP servers independently
 * Add project paths to KAMP
 * Link KAMP Projects to PHP server
 * Open Apache/MariaDB/PHP config files
 * Open PhpMyAdmin
 * Create a web console to visualize KAMP projects
 * Improve UI by adding stopped and started states
 
## Important Questions
 * Should Apache/MariaDB/PHP be packaged with KAMP or added as dependencies ?
